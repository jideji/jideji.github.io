I have attended a few of tech conferences in the last couple of years.
JavaOne and QConn in 2012, and JavaOne and LJC Open Conference in 2013.

That reminds me: 'Design Patterns In Modern JVM Languages' by [Venkat Subramaniam](https://twitter.com/venkat_s) is strongly recommended, attend if you can! Or at least watch the video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwxcI6FNbu4).

## Big vs small conference
So. JavaOne is huge. LJC Open Conference not very big. Which is best?

Naturally they have their positives and negatives.

JavaOne, because of its size, attracts lots of talented speakers and guests. They have maaany different tracks with different focus, so you have a lot to choose from.

LJC Open Conference on the other hand is informal. People decide on the day if they want to do a talk, the talks are sorted, and you pick what you want to attend. It is all very relaxed, you have experienced speaker mixed with first-timers, and it all feels very personal.

I personally prefer the smaller, more informal, type.
