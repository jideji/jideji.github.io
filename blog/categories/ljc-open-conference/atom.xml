    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have attended a few of tech conferences in the last couple of years.
JavaOne and QConn in 2012, and JavaOne and LJC Open Conference in 2013.</p>

<p>That reminds me: &lsquo;Design Patterns In Modern JVM Languages&rsquo; by <a href="https://twitter.com/venkat_s">Venkat Subramaniam</a> is strongly recommended, attend if you can! Or at least watch the video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwxcI6FNbu4">YouTube</a>.</p>

<h2>Big vs small conference</h2>

<p>So. JavaOne is huge. LJC Open Conference not very big. Which is best?</p>

<p>Naturally they have their positives and negatives.</p>

<p>JavaOne, because of its size, attracts lots of talented speakers and guests. They have maaany different tracks with different focus, so you have a lot to choose from.</p>

<p>LJC Open Conference on the other hand is informal. People decide on the day if they want to do a talk, the talks are sorted, and you pick what you want to attend. It is all very relaxed, you have experienced speaker mixed with first-timers, and it all feels very personal.</p>

<p>I personally prefer the smaller, more informal, type.</p>
